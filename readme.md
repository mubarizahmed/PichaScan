## Features

- ### Scanner Support

  PichaScan uses the WIA driver and can scan photos directly from most scanners. It also supports configuring the scanner settings, such as DPI and color mode.

- ### Auto-Cropping

  PichaScan automatically detects and crops photos from the scanned image. You can also adjust the cropping area manually if needed. Multiple photos can be scanned in a single scan, and PichaScan will crop them individually speeding up the process.

- ### Tagging
  PichaScan allows you to tag photos with timestamps and locations. The locations can be added by browsing the map. The tags are saved in the photo's metadata, making them searchable in the future.

- ### Project Management

  PichaScan allows you to create projects to organize your photos. You can scan photos directly into a project, keeping the same project settings for all photos.



## Download

Currently, PichaScan is only available for Windows.

You can download the latest Windows release [here](https://github.com/mubarizahmed/PichaScan/releases/latest).

## Contributing

PichaScan is not under active development currently. It is a hobby project and functional for my personal use. 

However, I am open to contributions and suggestions. You can contribute by opening an issue or submitting a pull request.
